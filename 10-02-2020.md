### Data Structures

A _data structure_ is a representation of data that perform "efficiently" "suitabel" operations.

A data structure is aims to optimize more frequent operations.

Types:

- Static: build/read (usually primitive to build dynamic ds)
- Dynamic: static + insert/delete

efficienty (always relative to other DS):
- time
- space

Notations:

```
Big-oh       Ο(f)    upper asymptotic bound
Big-theta    θ(f)    average " "
Big-omega    Ω(f)    lower " "

f : ℕ -> ℝ+
```

For the _average case_ we need the input distribution.

For example: _quicksort_ is _log n_ if the input follows a random permutation distribution.
