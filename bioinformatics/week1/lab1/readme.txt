1st. Lab Session

The purpose of this lab is to check if the theory explained in class,
about the search algorithms for only one pattern, is still true. For
this goal you will execute the four algorithms (brute force,
horspool,BNDM and BOM) over  a DNA alphabet file with, at least 2Gb, and random patterns of length k such that (1<=k<=inf).

You can find the code of the algorithms in the web page
http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/index.html
and for every algorithm there is a usefull applet that can help you to
understand the algorithm. Also you can download from my web page the
code of brute force and Horspool algorithms.

You should deliver a report with three graphs:

- a first graf (running time/length of the pattern) with the running
time of the four algorithms. Note that the running time should not
compress the time to read, generate or print data.
- a second graph (algorithm/length of the pattern) with the most
efficient algorithm for every length.
-a third graph (number of patterns found/length of the pattern) that
,of course, should be the same for all algorithms.
